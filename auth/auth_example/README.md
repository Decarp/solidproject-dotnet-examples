# Overview for Auth_Example

An example Blazor Server Application leveraging ODIC to login to the Solid Community Server locally. Makes use of [IdentityModel.OidcClient](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient) which is licensed as Apache 2.0.

This project assumes you have started up the [Solid Community Server](https://github.com/solid/community-server) locally on your machine and that it is running at http://localhost:3000/. For startup instructions on the Solid Community Server, see [here](https://solidproject.org//self-hosting/css).
