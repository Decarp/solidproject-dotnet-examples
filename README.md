# Overview
Contains various examples of dotnet projects as I try to learn how to use [Solid](https://solidproject.org/). All examples are MIT licensed, unless the underlying libaries have their own licenses.

# Projects
* "auth\auth_example" - A Blazor WebServer application that has a single button to login to a [Solid Community Server](https://github.com/solid/community-server) running locally on your machine. This is an attempt at reproducing the [first app](https://solidproject.org/developers/tutorials/first-app) demo on the Solid Project site.
